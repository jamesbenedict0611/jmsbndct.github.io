During his years of wandering, Yuanwu reflected on his past mistakes and honed his martial arts skills. With his expanding knowledge and improved techniques, he gradually grasped the essence of Leihuangquan — the art of balance between strength and adaptability. "</p>

                    <p>" Shorekeeper, the guardian of the Black Shores, is born from a light blue crystal cocoon of Remnant Energy, meant to complete the Reverberations. As the world edges toward its frozen end, she is awakened by the Astral Modulator, who guides her through the complexities of human emotions. Witnessing both joy and despair during a Lament, she begins to question her purpose and the nature of companionship. Through shared experiences, she learns about choices and the unpredictable nature of life. Ultimately, she defines herself not just as a tool but as a companion, yearning to be a shore where others can find rest. In this journey, she discovers that her identity is shaped by the bonds she forms along the way. "</p>
